<br>dass Gamestop mehr wert ist als die 4 $ für die die Aktie zu dem Zeitpunkt gehandelt wurde. 
<br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue">Roaring Kitty</a>, war im September 2019 einer der Ersten, der die Aktie für unterbewertet hielt.
<br>
<br>Andere Affen waren der gleichen Meinung und mochten die Aktie einfach.
<br>
<br>Da viele Affen die Aktie gekauft haben, ist ihr Wert gestiegen. 
<br>
<br>Die Affen haben ausserdem ihre Analysen (sogenannte "DD"s) auf Reddit veröffentlicht und sich diese gegenseitig korrigiert.
<br>So ist nach und nach klar geworden, daß mehr Aktien von Gamestop verliehen worden sind, als es Aktien gibt.
<br>Als das klar war, haben immer mehr Affen Gamestock-Aktien gekauft, was den Preis für die Aktie nach oben getrieben hat. 
<br>Das war jetzt natürlich ungünstig für diejenigen (Hedgefunds, kurz HFs), die die Aktie geshortet hatten.
<br>
<br>Um den Preis wieder zu drücken haben die HFs und ihre Geschäftspartner alle möglichen Tricks versucht.
<br>Die werd ich jetzt hier nicht auflisten, weil das würde meinen Zeit(Rahmen) sprengen.
<br>
<br>Momentan sieht es so aus als ob ganz viele Kleinanleger (Affen) die Aktien besitzen und die HFs diese zurückkaufen müssen.
<br>Wenn jetzt aber keiner der Affen seine Aktie(n) verkaufen will, kann der Preis für eine Aktie ins unendliche steigen.
<br>Das hängt davon ab, ob die shorts gecovered wurden oder nicht. 
<br>

<br>Am 21. April 2021 hat <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt">Atobitt</a> den ersten Teil seines DDs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/">House of Cards</a> veröffentlicht.
<br>In diesem beschreibt er wie der "kleine Mensch" an der Börse von den großen Anlegern abgezogen wird.
<br><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n2k2e4/counter_to_the_everything_short_updated/">seems like attobit had some misconceptions</a>

<br>Falls dir Frankfurt zu links klingt <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Schule">(Frankfurter Schule)</a>, vielleicht sagt dir dieses <a href="https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy"><b>Buch</b></a> mehr zu :)
<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVY2Kco8ng">Oder schau dir das aktuelle Interview mit der Autorin an</a>
<br>
<br>Das sind keine neuen Informationen, aber weil so viele Affen ihr Erspartes in Gamestock-Aktien angelegt haben ist das Ding viral gegangen.
<br>D.h. das sehr viele Menschen, die das sonst nicht gelesen haetten, 
<br>das Vertrauen in die Aktienmärkte (und die großen <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/client-center/DTC/alpha.pdf">Akteure</a>) verloren haben.

<br>
<br>Ab sofort wird von den Institutionen der Versuch gestartet werden, durch maximale Transparenz am Aktienmarkt Vertrauen/Kontrolle (wieder) herzustellen.
<br>Die amerikanische Börsenaufsicht (SEC) hat <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbisnoff/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair-as-agency-tackles-gamestop-saga-esg-boom-and-cryptocurrency/">seit Samstag einen neuen Boss</a>, der <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>spezialist ist.
<br>
<br>Ich tippe darauf das in Zukunft der Aktienhandel über NFT's und Blockchain organisiert werden soll.

<br>
<br>Es gibt drei Szenarien die ich gerade für möglich halte:
<br>
<br>1. 
<br>Die HFs haben ihre shorts beim großen dip gecovert. 
<br>Die Affen verlieren das Geld, das sie eingesetzt haben.
