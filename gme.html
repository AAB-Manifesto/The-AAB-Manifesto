<br><b>GameStop is the biggest offline video game vendor.</b>
<br>
<br>Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund">hedgefunds</a> made a bet that GameStop will reach bankruptcy soon (stock market lingo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)">shortet</a>)
<br>You short by borrowing a share of a stock and later on selling it again.
<br>Now, when the stock price goes down and you buy your share back, the difference of your first payment will be your benefit.
<br>If the stock price goes up though, this difference will be your loss. 
<br>After a certain amount of time, you will have to give your share back. No matter what price it is now, you will have to buy it.
<br>
<br><a href="https://www.konicz.info/?p=4303">Everything is bigger in Texas</a>
<br> 
<br>In fall 2019 a few self-labeled apes bet in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">Wallstreetbets</a> that the GameStop share would be worth more than the 4$ it cost at that moment. 
<br> In September 2019 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue">Roaring Kitty</a>,  was one of the first to say that that stock was undervalued.
<br>
<br>Other apes thought the same and just liked the stock.
<br>
<br>Because so many apes bought this share, its price went up. 
<br>
<br>The apes shared their analysis (socalled "DD"s) on the stock at <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> where they would correct each others analysis.
<br>In this process, it has gotten clear that there were more shares borrowed than there actually are shares!
<br>As soon as that was out, many more apes bought GameStop shares, which made the stock's worth rise fast. 
<br>This was a little of a pain in the ass for the people who shorted the GameStop share in the first place (Hedgefunds, shrt. HFs).
<br>
<br>To lower the price, HFs and their partners tried some tricks, which I'm not gonna list here since that would take too much time.
<br>
<br>Right now it looks like many small Investors (the apes) own shares, which the HFs will have to buy back.
<br>Nonetheless, if the apes won't sell their shares, their price could rise to infinity and beyond!
<br>This depends on whether the shorts are covered or not.

<br>Yesterday on the 21st on April 2021, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt">Atobitt</a> shared the first part of his DD <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/">House of Cards</a>
<br>In which he describes how small Investors get ripped off by big Investors.
<br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n2k2e4/counter_to_the_everything_short_updated/">seems like atobitt had some misconceptions</a>

<br>In case you dont deem some rando reddit ape a legit source, <a href="https://www.ilf-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/ILF_WP_068.pdf">Frankfurt Institute of Law and Finance</a> on that topic :)
<br>In case Frankfurt sounds to lefty for you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School">(Frankfurt School)</a>, maybe <a href="https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy"><b>this book</b></a> rings your bell

<br>
<br>This isnt any new information really. But since so many apes invested their money in gamestock, the post went viral.
<br>This means that many small Investors lost their faith in the stock market and the big <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/client-center/DTC/alpha.pdf">actors.</a>
<br>
<br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n21ml0/amc_and_gme_why_share_price_doesnt_matter_right/">A system nobody trusts cannot work.</a> 
<br>
<br>From now on, institutions will try to gain back the people's trust with maximal tranparency in the stock market.
<br>The american stockwatch (SEC) swore in <a  href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbisnoff/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair-as-agency-tackles-gamestop-saga-esg-boom-and-cryptocurrency/">their new boss</a> on saturday last week, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a> specialist. 
<br>
<br>My guess is, that in the future the stock market will be organized over blockchains and NFTs.

<br>
<br>There are 3 scenarios that seem probable to me right now:
<br>
<br>1. 
<br>The HFs covered their shorts. 
<br>The apes lose their investment.
